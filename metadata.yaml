description: Confessions is the name of a series of thirteen autobiographical books
  by St. Augustine of Hippo written between AD 397 and AD 398. In modern times, the
  books are usually published as a single volume known as The Confessions of St. Augustine
  . The works outline Augustine's sinful youth and his conversion to Christianity.
  It is widely seen as the first Western autobiography ever written, and was an influential
  model for Christian writers throughout the following 1000 years of the Middle Ages.
  It is not a complete autobiography, as it was written in his early 40s, and he lived
  long afterwards, p.
